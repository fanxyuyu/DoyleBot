## About

This is just a simple discord bot that was made entirely in python using the [Discord py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API. The bot is currently deployed on [Heroku](heroku.com).

Everything was made with the intention of learning more about python in a fun and interactive way.


## How to start

To get the bot to work you should download the source code and follow the next steps:
  1. Create a Heroku account and create a new project
  2. Create a git repository with the same files (you'll just need to add the Procfile and requirements files besides the base code)
  3. Deploy directly from the repository link on the heroku project page and be happy :)
